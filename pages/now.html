        <p>
          a 22-year-old computer science student who spends most of his time
          between hostel life, code, and long thoughts about the world. I’m not
          here to pretend I have it all figured out — I’m still learning, still
          trying, and still messing up. But I believe in movement — slow,
          stubborn progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m currently studying in a CS engineering program and trying to build
          things that are useful, simple, and maybe a bit meaningful. That
          includes websites, travel tools, and a SaaS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not chasing “hustle” life, but I do believe in consistency,
          clarity, and quiet confidence. I write sometimes, mostly for myself —
          to understand, not to impress. I build with what I have — a minimal
          budget, a laptop, and a head full of ideas I’m trying to turn real.
          This blog isn’t a polished portfolio. It’s a trail map. You’ll find
          half-finished thoughts, side projects, small experiments, and some
          honest notes on trying to become a better climber — in tech, in life,
          and sometimes literally (I’ve started mountain trekking too).
        </p>

          exploring, you can check out my
