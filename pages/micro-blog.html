            ​I am just assessing how my life in last 2-3 days feels aimless,
            goals doesn't have some motivation for work. Only sleep coming, not
            have enough will for work. ​I can easily say that why it is
            happening, that any girl came to my life. It is for the first time
            so it totally feel weird. ​Look what i have done,i changed by
            profile picture on instagram, posting stories i think she like me
            like wars, mountain, travel, philosophy etc. , i generally don't use
            instagram, but for the sake of attention i use instagram & waste my
            time. Doom scrolling , stress and that cycle loop. ​Now i check
            whatsapp to see that she sent me something or replied or not.
            Feeling FOMO every time. ​Now, I think of just leave that girl for
            in my mind like detachmnet. what she think i don't care...

            hey sameer, i have been tired of being in this crowd and empty noise
            of people, now i want to go to live in mountain all by books and
            notebook solving algorithm and maths etc.like really deep session
            without devices that will enhances by problem solving. got into
            really problem solving really feel the struggle and embrace raw
            life. cutting wood, future planning, and i don't know what i will
            get,making and cooking my own food just like Carl Jung did.really
            owning my own and becoming real self, throwing mask being who i am.
            think of like sabbatical for 1 year. although i keep my devices to
            go downhill in city between 10- 15 days to just push my code all and
            run my program, but mostly analog thing i will be using.

            this is the place called jobra in manali where me, vishu and yash
            camped and in morning two other joined vivek and suraj, that's a
            great time , totally worth it , thanks for all that all of you. i
            like the places where i don't perform just to seek attention,
            seeking attention is like losing piece of oneself, becoming crowd,
            if you are seeking attention to just prove then obviously i am
            playing the wrong game. this is i am thinking of after 4th year. but
            i know my parents will revolt in regarding jobs or money etc or
            safety why this wierd shit, what i can do this is my inner sense.
            and inner sense is my compass etc.... thanks sameer to live this
            much life on earth greatly but you have lot to improve.. thanks my
            parents who gave all the resources to study and living, food
            literally all the thing in luxury way, thanks again.. let me forgive
            all who have hurt me and forgive me too if i hurt them now there is
            no weight on my shoulder etc...

            my biggest weakness in my life is not porn addiction, not
            communicating well, not physique, not insecurity, but: "Starting
            thing that I don't able to finish". any course, books, etc. Jumping
            from one course to another, this playlist to others, this book to
            that book, fr. ex: starting javascript by super side but not
            finishing etc. You are like catching rabbit many at once so you
            don't able to catch one. Reading books that I don't finish. So now I
            have started the react course, if I switch to other course. That
            means again I'm repeating the same mistake. So my biggest commitment
            is to learn small but learn daily, if you can not understand, it's
            mean you are just avoiding or running away from fear. and one more
            thing you can't improve all at once, you just have to pick one.
            improve all at once. Impossible. Become performer not strategist/
            don't go into intellectual mental masturbation by acquiring
            knowledge. Just have goal what to build startup working on it. you
            have to learn by practice -> the only way you can learn. Take
            Action! Take Action! Take Action! Take Action! Only way to improve,
            not be whose who philosophy only acquire knowledge, never use it...

            i have realised that i am judging other more than normal i think i

            most : no youtube ( i have downloaded lecture offline using
            <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> , no reddit,
            no any shopping site ( except if i have to track order or receive )

            online... that's it... and on phone minimal launcher for 2 days.. my
            main goal is to just get two days break from getting more
            information. i say that information diet for 2 days. this is will
            help me focus on meaningful work, and confront to myself

            <h2>backbiting</h2>
            today i have come across the very realization that i have been
            backbiting people from very birth. till now i know the meaning of
            backbiting is - telling secret of people to other and i was
            satisfied that i am not backbiting other. but today i know the exact
            definition of what actually backbiting is when i was talking with
            one of my friend he explained me what actually backbiting is he says
            anything that harm other person dignity is backbiting. then fuck i
            am backbiting and lowering my standard in all my childhood, although
            i don't typically backbite other like girls and never spread false
            of anyone. i spread true ( but negative ) of others that attack
            other person dignity and character. what actually backbiting is :
            read this article
            <a href="https://myislam.org/backbiting-in-islam/"
              >https://myislam.org/backbiting-in-islam/</a
            >
            what actually hit was this : In the hadith of Abu Dawud 4874,
            Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was asked a question about Ghibah (backbiting).
            Someone came to him and said what if what I say about my brother is
            in fact truth? Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) replied, if are right, you have
            slandered him, and if what you say of him is not true, you have
            reviled him. [1] my key takeaway is - وَيْلٌ لِكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ
            لُمَزَةٍ “Woe to every persistent slanderer, persistent defamer” “I
            will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of
            everybody.” ― Benjamin Franklin On the flip side… If you are a
            victim of backbiting take comfort in knowing that they are only
            helping you on the day of judgement. Of course protect your
            character if you feel it is threatened but do so with integrity. Do
            not fall victim by engaging in the same game. We must show
            discipline and emotional fortitude and overcome such petty
            altercations.
            <p>
              from now on i am not going to talk ill of anyone, never spread
              negative information of other person even if it is true, not bcz
              it is harm other dignity and respect but also it is lowering my
              character as a man. controlling tongue is very important for the
              exchange of temporary relief.

            when we reach in our 20s we try to rationalize every decision for

            cause life long drift in direction.don't attach with any identity if

            The “Shredding Alarm Clock” is a quirky, motivational device
            designed to punish snoozing. It functions like a normal alarm clock,
            but with a twist: when the alarm goes off, you must turn it off
            within a set time, or a small motorized shredder destroys whatever
            is placed your real money . The device combines an alarm system, a
            motorized shredder, and a microcontroller to enforce punctuality in
            a fun and slightly mischievous way. It’s a playful reminder that
            procrastination—or oversleeping—can come at a cost!

            Tynan Notes on Friendship
            <p>How To Make Amazing Friends</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Value friendships: They bring more joy than careers or
                possessions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be excellent: Improve yourself, know your worth, be a friend
                others feel lucky to have.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be intentional: Identify traits you want in friends and choose
                carefully.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritize time: Spend it with people who help you grow; better
                alone than with the wrong people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be patient: Building a strong friend group takes time and
                gradual introductions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contribute positively: Actively improve your friends’ lives
                whenever possible.
              </li>
            </ul>

            How To Make Lots of Great Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Value people: Friends and family are the most important source
                of gratitude.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t be annoying: Self-awareness is key; eliminate habits that
                push people away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leverage introductions: Trust is involved when someone
                introduces you—make them look good.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bring value: Contribute positively to friends’ lives (humor,
                listening, advice, organizing).
              </li>
              <li>
                Be proactive: Friendship shouldn’t be left to chance; engage,
                introspect, and actively improve your social life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Making Friends with Awesome People
            <ul>
              <li>
                Friend circles matter: Being proactive about building a great
                friend group is crucial.
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand sought-after people: Popular or well-connected people
                are cautious—time with them is limited and valuable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide value & be unneedy: Ensure they enjoy your company,
                don’t impose, and avoid asking for favors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be a connector: Introduce new people to your existing friends;
                it multiplies social opportunities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meet people in person: Hanging out where your desired friends
                already are is more effective than cold emailing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Focus on quality, not fame: Build friendships for shared values
                and connection, not prestige or personal gain
              </li>
            </ul>
            Treating Strangers Like Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Treat everyone like a friend: Engage strangers genuinely,
                listen, and respond as if they’re real people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple habits matter: Small gestures (like asking questions,
                sharing a bit of yourself) create meaningful connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Technology can reduce substance: Personal, thoughtful
                interactions matter more than scripted or surface-level
                communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mutual benefit: Treating others well feels good and often
                encourages reciprocal kindness
              </li>
              <li>
                Friends vs strangers: People are willing to go further for
                friends; treating strangers warmly can sometimes elevate them to
                friend-like status.
              </li>
              <li>
                Real-world examples: Genuine friendliness leads to unexpected
                favors, opportunities, and deeper connections.
              </li>

              <li>
                Happiness formula: Being human and kind fosters connection and
                increases personal joy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Have Less Acquaintances, More Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Prioritize quality over quantity: Cutting back on socializing
                and acquaintances allows more focus on truly meaningful
                friendships.
              </li>
              <li>
                Acquaintances aren’t free: Time spent with shallow connections
                reduces energy and time for potential or existing deep
                friendships.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prune the noise: Reducing superficial interactions clarifies
                patterns in the friends you truly value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Patterns in great friends: Good people: Positive, noble,
                inspiring actions; Optimistic mindset: Resilient and
                forward-looking even in adversity; Ambitious/entrepreneurial:
                Many have intentionally chosen impactful careers or ventures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use patterns for screening: Focus energy on people who fit these
                traits, and limit time with those who don’t.
              </li>
              <li>
                Outcome: Fewer acquaintances, stronger connections, and
                friendships that inspire growth.
              </li>

            i was on some women forum on reddit and i also generally observed
            women saying like “ i want a guy, here is my list - i think that guy
            that checks all ticks in my list ( for e.g. 6 ft tall, muscular ,
            rich, jawline , fairness, etc all the bullshit you heard of commonly
            ” but on the contrary i think it is exactly same you go to buying
            stuff like suppose i want to buy powerful pc and in my list i want
            feature like ryzen 5, 16gb ram, 4k monitor , vertical and
            horizontal, logitech mouse, keychron Q1 max mechanical keyboard - if
            all the stuff matches my list i will buy same like women selects
            men.

              so a what man can do is just live- invert the game , not get

              guy who is on her to-do list i just calmly remove from my mind
              entirely, no hate. be aware even if you checks all of her list
              don't go for her, it's not worth your time and happiness and
              peace. it's a list for using stuff like you will use pc exactly
              same as women use men. don't get confused with love. True love
              needs no editing — it embraces the soul exactly as it is. -
              Bhagvat Gita. always think of in abundance if that is not then
              move there are many women.. peace off..if you’re reading this
              don’t make mistake of that i don’t able to get girls/women that’s
