            <h2>backbiting</h2>
            today i have come across the very realization that i have been
            backbiting people from very birth. till now i know the meaning of
            backbiting is - telling secret of people to other and i was
            satisfied that i am not backbiting other. but today i know the exact
            definition of what actually backbiting is when i was talking with
            one of my friend he explained me what actually backbiting is he says
            anything that harm other person dignity is backbiting. then fuck i
            am backbiting and lowering my standard in all my childhood, although
            i don't typically backbite other like girls and never spread false
            of anyone. i spread true ( but negative ) of others that attack
            other person dignity and character. what actually backbiting is :
            read this article
            <a href="https://myislam.org/backbiting-in-islam/"
              >https://myislam.org/backbiting-in-islam/</a
            >
            what actually hit was this : In the hadith of Abu Dawud 4874,
            Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was asked a question about Ghibah (backbiting).
            Someone came to him and said what if what I say about my brother is
            in fact truth? Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) replied, if are right, you have
            slandered him, and if what you say of him is not true, you have
            reviled him. [1] my key takeaway is - وَيْلٌ لِكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ
            لُمَزَةٍ “Woe to every persistent slanderer, persistent defamer” “I
            will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of
            everybody.” ― Benjamin Franklin On the flip side… If you are a
            victim of backbiting take comfort in knowing that they are only
            helping you on the day of judgement. Of course protect your
            character if you feel it is threatened but do so with integrity. Do
            not fall victim by engaging in the same game. We must show
            discipline and emotional fortitude and overcome such petty
            altercations.
            <p>
              from now on i am not going to talk ill of anyone, never spread
              negative information of other person even if it is true, not bcz
              it is harm other dignity and respect but also it is lowering my
              character as a man. controlling tongue is very important for the
              exchange of temporary relief.

            when we reach in our 20s we try to rationalize every decision for
            example like i should not behave like this or that i am not that

            cause life long drift in direction.don't attach with any identity if
            it will not benefit you, like i am not the person who goes into

            <p>Future Cool idea to build :-</p>
            The “Shredding Alarm Clock” is a quirky, motivational device
            designed to punish snoozing. It functions like a normal alarm clock,
            but with a twist: when the alarm goes off, you must turn it off
            within a set time, or a small motorized shredder destroys whatever
            is placed your real money . The device combines an alarm system, a
            motorized shredder, and a microcontroller to enforce punctuality in
            a fun and slightly mischievous way. It’s a playful reminder that
            procrastination—or oversleeping—can come at a cost!

            Tynan Notes on Friendship
            <p>How To Make Amazing Friends</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Value friendships: They bring more joy than careers or
                possessions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be excellent: Improve yourself, know your worth, be a friend
                others feel lucky to have.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be intentional: Identify traits you want in friends and choose
                carefully.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritize time: Spend it with people who help you grow; better
                alone than with the wrong people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be patient: Building a strong friend group takes time and
                gradual introductions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contribute positively: Actively improve your friends’ lives
                whenever possible.
              </li>
            </ul>

            How To Make Lots of Great Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Value people: Friends and family are the most important source
                of gratitude.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t be annoying: Self-awareness is key; eliminate habits that
                push people away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leverage introductions: Trust is involved when someone
                introduces you—make them look good.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bring value: Contribute positively to friends’ lives (humor,
                listening, advice, organizing).
              </li>
              <li>
                Be proactive: Friendship shouldn’t be left to chance; engage,
                introspect, and actively improve your social life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Making Friends with Awesome People
            <ul>
              <li>
                Friend circles matter: Being proactive about building a great
                friend group is crucial.
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand sought-after people: Popular or well-connected people
                are cautious—time with them is limited and valuable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide value & be unneedy: Ensure they enjoy your company,
                don’t impose, and avoid asking for favors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be a connector: Introduce new people to your existing friends;
                it multiplies social opportunities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meet people in person: Hanging out where your desired friends
                already are is more effective than cold emailing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Focus on quality, not fame: Build friendships for shared values
                and connection, not prestige or personal gain
              </li>
            </ul>
            Treating Strangers Like Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Treat everyone like a friend: Engage strangers genuinely,
                listen, and respond as if they’re real people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple habits matter: Small gestures (like asking questions,
                sharing a bit of yourself) create meaningful connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Technology can reduce substance: Personal, thoughtful
                interactions matter more than scripted or surface-level
                communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mutual benefit: Treating others well feels good and often
                encourages reciprocal kindness
              </li>
              <li>
                Friends vs strangers: People are willing to go further for
                friends; treating strangers warmly can sometimes elevate them to
                friend-like status.
              </li>
              <li>
                Real-world examples: Genuine friendliness leads to unexpected
                favors, opportunities, and deeper connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Real-world examples: Genuine friendliness leads to unexpected
                favors, opportunities, and deeper connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Happiness formula: Being human and kind fosters connection and
                increases personal joy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Have Less Acquaintances, More Friends
            <ul>
              <li>
                Prioritize quality over quantity: Cutting back on socializing
                and acquaintances allows more focus on truly meaningful
                friendships.
              </li>
              <li>
                Acquaintances aren’t free: Time spent with shallow connections
                reduces energy and time for potential or existing deep
                friendships.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prune the noise: Reducing superficial interactions clarifies
                patterns in the friends you truly value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Patterns in great friends: Good people: Positive, noble,
                inspiring actions; Optimistic mindset: Resilient and
                forward-looking even in adversity; Ambitious/entrepreneurial:
                Many have intentionally chosen impactful careers or ventures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use patterns for screening: Focus energy on people who fit these
                traits, and limit time with those who don’t.
              </li>
              <li>
                Outcome: Fewer acquaintances, stronger connections, and
                friendships that inspire growth.

            rich, jawline , fairness, etc all the bullshit you heard of commonly
            ” but on the contrary i think it is exactly same you go to buying
            stuff like suppose i want to buy powerful pc and in my list i want
            feature like ryzen 5, 16gb ram, 4k monitor , vertical and
            horizontal, logitech mouse, keychron Q1 max mechanical keyboard - if
            all the stuff matches my list i will buy same like women selects
            men.

              so a what man can do is just live- invert the game , not get
              played by women, what i do is whenever i think that she is finding
              guy who is on her to-do list i just calmly remove from my mind
              entirely, no hate. be aware even if you checks all of her list
              don't go for her, it's not worth your time and happiness and
              peace. it's a list for using stuff like you will use pc exactly
              same as women use men. don't get confused with love. True love
              needs no editing — it embraces the soul exactly as it is. -
              Bhagvat Gita. always think of in abundance if that is not then
              move there are many women.. peace off..if you’re reading this
              don’t make mistake of that i don’t able to get girls/women that’s
              why i am writing bitterly against women, i have/had many
              experiences than you…

            no amount of money, fame, product can bring you peace if you don't
            able to beat resistance that limiting your potential. no matter
            there is about porn addiction or study 4 hour per day for 5 years.
            until resistance beat you, you're just living external thing losing
            yourself just for attention and praise.keep youself alive by chasing
            best of you from yesterday you was. best analogy is "man is rock and
            sculptor of himself". by the way others around you are all still
            just silly child, just avoid them...

            i love how people simply play games without knowing, trying to
            dominate and manipulate - don't give fuck just move on or play
            better games or better manipulative tactics and be dominant. that's
            why like machiavelli..

            Until you go till the extreme, you can’t find balance. before is the
            path of moderation and mediocrity. like buddha find middle path when
            he goes to the extreme like after living luxury to till death
            asceticism and hence concluded with "the middle path"
