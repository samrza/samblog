          the only thing i like about casio f91w is it's just only and only
          watch, nothing more than that. it's lightweight ( 21 g), sleek, made
          of plastic, cheap, no fear of damage because its so rugged and cheap,
          waterprooof, battery runs for 7+ years.
        </p>

        <p>
          it has not very advanced feature like bluetooth , call, big dial
          watch, heart beat tracker, running tracker etc anything. it has only
          feature the watch should have like time, stopwatch, very slight and
          minimal green light that can only be used in very essential dark
          place, 24 hour clock, alarm, day, date that's it, this is more than
          enough for me to using watch.

          btw nowadays it's become fashion or trend to wear casio f91w,
          accidently i also come across this trendy time but i not influenced by
          some sort of fashion but i was simply looking for a reliable,
          no-nonsense watch. as a need for only watch i come across subreddit
          see all the people suggesting me a=casio f91 w.
        </p>

        <p>i'm glad that i gave a try, it's worth it...</p>
