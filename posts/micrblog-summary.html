        <h2>Fitness / Body</h2>

        <h3>Push-Up Proper Form (Simple Notes)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Body Position:</strong> Squeeze your glutes, tighten your abs,
          and keep your lower back flat. Do not raise or sag your hips. Your
          body should stay like a strong plank.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shoulders:</strong> At the top of every rep, push the floor
          away and spread your shoulder blades apart. Keep the shoulder blades
          flat against the ribs. Do not let the shoulders stick out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hand Position:</strong> Place your hands slightly wider than
          shoulder width. Spread your fingers wide. Turn your hands slightly
          outward so the index fingers face forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Elbows:</strong> Keep your elbows close to your body. Do not
          let them flare out to the sides. Close elbows protect your shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Forearms:</strong> Keep your forearms vertical. Lean your
          shoulders slightly forward. Do not allow the forearms to tilt
          backward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Movement:</strong> Lower your chest toward the floor with
          control. Use full range of motion. Push up until your arms are fully
          straight. Every rep should start and finish strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Incline Push-Ups:</strong> If floor push-ups are too hard, use
          a wall, table, or counter. Walk your feet back into a plank and apply
          the same rules: tight glutes, tight abs, elbows close. Aim for 3 sets
          of 8 clean reps, resting 2–3 minutes. Lower the height when it becomes
          easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plank:</strong> Hold a plank on the floor using the same body
          position as a push-up. Planks build the core strength needed for
          proper push-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do Not Do:</strong> Knee push-ups, half reps, elbow flare, or
          loose body positions.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Perfect form first. Strength comes later.</p>

        <h2>Self-Improvement / Discipline</h2>

        <p>self-improvement is good</p>

        <p>
          my biggest weakness in my life is not porn addiction, not
          communicating well, not physique, not insecurity, but: "Starting thing
          that I don't able to finish". any course, books, etc. Jumping from one
          course to another, this playlist to others, this book to that book,
          fr. ex: starting javascript by super side but not finishing etc...
        </p>

        <p>
          integrity : it's a choice between what convenient and whats right.
          hard tk develop bcz it need courage radical honestly, but this is the
          only way to truly live
        </p>

        <p>
          i was on some women forum on reddit and i also generally observed
          women saying like “ i want a guy, here is my list - i think that guy
          that checks all ticks in my list ( for e.g. 6 ft tall, muscular ,
          rich, jawline , fairness, etc all the bullshit you heard of commonly
          ”...

        <h2>Ideas</h2>

        <p>
          Future Cool idea to build :- The “Shredding Alarm Clock” is a quirky,
          motivational device designed to punish snoozing. It functions like a
          normal alarm clock, but with a twist: when the alarm goes off, you
          must turn it off within a set time, or a small motorized shredder
          destroys whatever is placed your real money...
        </p>
