        <p>
          i realised whats difference between reading and learning when i was
          try to move 100MB file in my pen drive.... when i read i think i know
          but when i was not able to do even this simple task , then only i
          realised i read it incorrectly or i not read properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          everything i read with my mobile... that means distracted reading..
          only focus on reading not on next word, what it means , what concept
          it giving , you barely focus and sometimes skip sentence that you
          think you know it already. that is the major difference between
          reading and learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          learn like this : read full understanding comprehension read line by
          line, ask whats the concept and what this thing means, what is exact
          concept behind it ? not just reading for sake of reading or surface
          skimming reading. only attention and focus lead to learning , no
          multitasking and no distraction , mobile screen +notifications kill
          your focus very fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          so i have to do this method now for all books and article that i read
          and i see result super fast if i implement proper way of reading.
        </p>

        <p>
          now next is about salary and money philosophy , most people are scared
          or dance around salary than acquiring skill , they think salary is
          important then money comes then skill later. this is wrong. skill lead
          to money and money lead to security that give freedom and until you
          have money that protected your security or protection then only you
          able to do deep stuff. that is why i need money as first goal in short
          term , but still as a long term i have to build that skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          i have to think about this cause of skill > money > freedom model and
          how my workflow and my progress which i do daily work. so i have to
          also fight with distraction while i am reading also.. i am reading
          many article and books without actually getting learnd or idea from
          that, that is bad reading habit, i have to read slowly and by
          understanding every line.
        </p>

        <p>
          now how i will do deep work in my life is this : i will set a plan for
          next day before sleep , and i will schedule my day with list of thing
          to do and also with time, what i have to do after i wake up. this i
          feel it will force me to follow the plan and schedule. i also notice
          that i loose control of plan when i not schedule it time by time. that
          cause distraction and bad status quo of getting lost and then
          procrasinate .
        </p>

        <p>
          next thing is that i noticed that when i do deep work i feel more
          satisfaction after completing deep work job and i feel confident and
          my brain deeply feels restful than shallow work like youtube or
          internet browsing.. that feel relaxed and calm.
        </p>

        <p>
          last thing i noticed is that when you start your deep work , always
          start with difficult part that cause friction first then second easy
          part that you think easy to do.
