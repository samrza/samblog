        <h2>Part 1: The Idea</h2>

        <p>
          deep work = rare , hard to replicate <br />
          shallow work = non demanding , easy replicable <br />
          deep life is not just economically lucarative but also life well lived
        </p>

        <h3>1. Deep Work is Valuable</h3>
        <p>
          Deep work reduces attention residue and leads to higher performance.
          streamlines attention and increase happiness ( neurological ).
          generates flow that satisfies our life ( flow - psychological ).
          mindset of craftmanship ( builder ). those who will thrive are - high
          skilled worker, superstars, owners.
        </p>

        <p>
          four pillar of deep work : two core abilities of thriving — ability to
          quickly master hard things; ability to produce at an elite level in
          terms of both quality and speed. quality determines opportunity time
          and speed determines competition out.
        </p>

        <p>
          how deep work enables mastery : deliberate practice. high quality work
          produced = time spent x intensity of focus.
        </p>

        <p>
          problem - attention residue. soln - work on single task for long
          period without switching.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Deep Work is Rare</h3>
        <p>
          shallow work is easier - so mass prefer. the principle of least
          resistance - we naturally gravitate towards what easier at that
          moment. busyness as proxy for productivity. culture of connectivity.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Deep Work is Meaningful</h3>
        <p>
          if you read flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi then you know why deep
          work is valuable. our brain construct our worldview based on what we
          pay attention to. deep work focus your attention on thing that matter
          creating richer mental world.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 2: The Rules (How to do Deep Work)</h2>

        <p>
          there are 4 ways you can incorporate deep work in your life: Monastic,
          Bimodal, Rhythmic, Journalistic. i prefer rythmic bcz this fits my
          lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule#1 : Work Deeply</h3>
        <p>
          willpower is limited, you have to establish routine. where/when/how
          (no distraction, metric for success, phone or other devices -nt).
          support: material organized in advance and ready. coffee or tea to
          initiate.
        </p>

        <p>
          4 discipline of execution (4dx): focus on wildly important - one or
          two, not catching rabbit. act on the lead measure - for deep work
          track hours. keep a compelling scorecard. create accountability -
          check what went wrong good/bad each week.
        </p>

        <p>
          shutdown ritual - complete mental shutdown. turn off all related to
          work after particular time. plan schedule for next day then completely
          off. this is crucisl for sustaining deep work.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule#2 : Embrace Boredom</h3>
        <p>
          the ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.
        </p>

        <p>
          strategy 1 - schedule your internet use. resist and be bored at that
          interval.
        </p>

        <p>
          strategy 2 - roosevelt dashes: identify high-priority deep work,
          estimate how long, set a hard deadline, work until completion.
        </p>

        <p>
          strategy 3 - productive meditation: walking, jogging, showering,
          driving, dishes etc. choose one well defined professional problem,
          define variables, work through mentally, consolidate afterward.
          obstacles: looping — acknowledge and go deeper. distraction —
          acknowledge and comeback.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule#3: Quit Social Media</h3>
        <p>
          problem - any-benefit mindset. soln : craftsmanship approach to tool
          selection.
        </p>

        <p>
          process: identify main professional and personal goals (2-3 each).
          identify 2-3 most important activities. assess each tool — positive
          impact? negative impact? keep if positive outweigh negative.
        </p>

        <p>
          THE LAW OF VITAL FEW (80/20 rule): out of many supporting tools, only
          few actually make significant difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          30 day social media ban challenge: ban for 30 days, don’t announce,
          don’t delete. after 30 days ask — would it be notably better if used?
          did people care? both no = quit permanently. both yes = resume.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule#4: Drain the Shallow</h3>
        <p>
          don’t spend more time on shallow work. time scarcity forces better
          decisions. schedule every minute of your day. time blocking method.
          quantify the depth of every activity. fixed schedule productivity —
          don’t work after end time. become hard to reach.
