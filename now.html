        <h1>Now</h1>

        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

        <p>I’m in my 3rd year of computer science.</p>

        <p>
          Right now my main focus is execution. Less planning, more building.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m working daily on DSA and practical coding. Finishing React
          properly. Goal is to build 2 real full-stack projects without relying
          on AI shortcuts.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m training deep work — aiming for consistent 3–4 hours of
          distraction-free work. Tracking hours. Cutting social media. Reducing
          noise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Physically, I’m trying to gain weight and build strength. Mostly
          push-ups, bodyweight training, and eating more consistently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Long term: I want skills that convert to money. Exploring small SaaS
          ideas and leverage-based work. Moving toward location-independent
          income.
        </p>

        <p>Reading slower. Implementing more.</p>

        <p>Reducing gossip, validation-seeking, and passive consumption.</p>

        <p>
          If you haven’t heard from me much, it’s because I’m trying to build
          something real.
