        <p>
          This year I have talked too much—like a gyanpelu. Too much explaining,
          too much planning, too much noise. It is time to change. As Machiavelli
          said, speak less to none. Make silence your best friend. The real
          benefit of silence is not mystery or attraction—it is constraint. When
          you stop talking, you are forced to communicate only through action.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do not believe in New Year logic. Sunday, Saturday, January—every day
          is just a day. Still, this is the first day of 2026, and I am starting
          with constraints: staying completely offline for 48 hours, spending 24
          hours without speaking a single word, staying off social media for 7
          days, and waking up at 6 a.m. for 30 days.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main goals of this year are clear: improve communication skills and
          body language, build two full-stack projects with real understanding
          (not AI slop), gain 5 kg of body weight, quit addiction, and fix hygiene
          and daily discipline. Money matters, but money is downstream of skill.
          Skill requires daily focused time.
        </p>

        <p>
          My priorities are simple: DSA first, full-stack development second,
          clear communication and English conversation third, trekking and
          survival skills next, and deeper understanding of Buddhism alongside
          discipline. These are doable if I stop avoiding hard work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Health is non-negotiable. I need to eat more, avoid junk food, and train
          with bodyweight exercises—pushups, pullups, squats, planks. First,
          master pushups properly. No fantasy fitness.
        </p>

        <p>
          One major rule this year: no more motivational content. Only consistency
          and discipline. No more “nice guy” behavior. If I say no, it means no.
          Being direct is not being rude—it is being honest. Less gossip, more
          doing. No envy. The only comparison that matters is whether I did what I
          said yesterday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communication is my weakest skill right now. I blabber, I get stuck, I
          speak softly, and anxiety takes over. This has to change. Clear and
          concise communication is the most important soft skill I can build. I
          will deliberately put myself in uncomfortable situations to remove
          fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Minimalism is not a trend for me; it is my natural state. Inspired by
          Tynan, I am returning to subtraction. Improving life by removing noise,
          possessions, and unnecessary people. Living in a hostel, I remove one
          item every day to regain freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          This mindset exposed my impulse buying. The Adidas shoe was a status
          purchase. If I apply Derek Sivers’ “Hell Yeah or No” rule, it was a
          clear no. From now on, I buy only what solves a real problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading is useful only if applied. I plan to read 20 books this year,
          but only if action follows. Right now, <em>The Freedom Model</em>,
          <em>Essentialism</em>, and <em>Ultralearning</em> matter the most. I
          need that phase of focused struggle that leads to flow.
        </p>

        <p>
          My biggest execution problem is fear—especially fear of solving DSA
          problems. Avoidance is killing my days. Watching videos and planning
          endlessly is fake progress. I see it clearly now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some days I do nothing. No lying anymore. Awareness without correction
          is useless.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this month onward, I will write one article every month—combining
          my mind-dump and book learnings. Writing is how I will track reality,
          not impress anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trekking, survival skills, and time in nature remain important.
          Discomfort builds resilience. Losing in many things is how
          antifragility is created.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year is not about saying more. It is about removing noise, showing
          up daily, and letting action speak.
        </p>

        <p>
          Silence. Discipline. Subtraction. Execution.
        </p>
        <p> <mark>chatGPT Summary : </mark>
             A self-aware CS student is trying to move from over-talking and planning to silence, discipline, and execution, influenced by minimalism (Tynan) and focused on skill, health, and clarity. The core theme is subtraction over noise and action over motivation. The main fault is fear-driven procrastination—especially avoiding DSA—along with weak communication and impulse consumption, while the strengths are honesty, long-term thinking, and willingness to confront flaws. The major win is gaining clear priorities and returning to discipline; the major loss is time wasted on fake progress and delayed execution.
