        <p>
          i call it "2 book rule"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, I’m convinced about reading more books, but I’m also aware that
          too much information can lead to inaction and mental masturbation. If
          I’m reading non-fiction, it should be for improving my life—meant to
          be used for action. But what I’ve been doing is just reading for the
          sake of it. What’s the point of that? So I’ve decided that from now
          on, I’ll read only 2 books at a time—not more, but at least 2. Two
          books per month are enough to improve my life. This way i can make space for taking action not just reading feel good content. Reading too much
          non-fiction just turns into feel-good mental masturbation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then a question came to my mind—so which two books will you read? My
          answer was simple: utility first. What I mean is, choose books that
          directly improve your life in the area you're currently struggling
          with—whether it's building habits, dealing with addiction, finding
          happiness, relationships, decision-making, career choices, or even
          playing games. The books should serve a purpose, not just fill time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll be real with you—some months back, I was struggling with porn
          addiction and dating dynamics. These were my problems. So I set my
          priorities straight and asked myself: Which one is the bigger issue I
          need to solve first? After a lot of thinking, I realized that porn
          addiction was the major problem holding me back. So that month, I
          chose to read two highly recommended books I found on Reddit and some
          blogs: The Freedom Model for Addiction by Mark Scheeren, Michelle
          Dunbar, and Steven Slate EasyPeasy Method by an unknown author These
          two books were so effective that they helped me solve the problem at
          the root level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, for the next month, I’ll shift my focus to dating dynamics. I’ve
          chosen: The Book of Pook & The Anti-Dump Machine Both by unknown
          authors, but widely respected in underground circles for their
          no-nonsense insights.
