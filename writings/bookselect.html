        <p>
          i call it "2 book rule"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, I’m convinced about reading more books, but I’m also aware that
          too much information can lead to inaction and mental masturbation. If
          I’m reading non-fiction, it should be for improving my life—meant to
          be used for action. But what I’ve been doing is just reading for the
          sake of it. What’s the point of that? So I’ve decided that from now
          on, I’ll read only 2 books at a time—not more, but at least 2. Two
          books per month are enough to improve my life. This way i can make space for taking action not just reading feel good content. Reading too much
          non-fiction just turns into feel-good mental masturbation.
        </p>

          Then a question came to my mind—so which two books will you read? My
          answer was simple: utility first. What I mean is, choose books that
          directly improve your life in the area you're currently struggling
          with—whether it's building habits, dealing with addiction, finding
          happiness, relationships, decision-making, career choices, or even
          playing games. The books should serve a purpose, not just fill time.
