        <mark>Testosterone</mark>
        <p>increase your testosterone to feel more masculine and confident.</p>
        <p>Women are naturally drawn to masculine (testosterone-filled) men.</p>
        <p>
          Testosterone affects mood, voice, posture, confidence, and physical
          traits.
        </p>
        <p>The main way he increased testosterone was through bodybuilding.</p>
        <p>He followed three key pillars:</p>
        <p>Sleep 8 hours regularly.</p>
        <p>
          Eat 6 protein-rich meals a day, avoid junk, and watch sugar/alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>Exercise with heavy weights (activating Type II muscle fibers).</p>
        <p>Smoking and alcohol reduce testosterone.</p>
        <p>
          High-testosterone people are often in public professions like acting,
          sports, or sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gained 70 pounds of muscle and feels much more powerful and
          confident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testosterone is described as the "fuel of men" — crucial for energy,
          attraction, and success.

        <mark>Gym</mark>
        <p>Real fitness depends on three basic things:</p>
        <p>Enough sleep – this is when your muscles grow.</p>
        <p>Good diet – this is the hardest part to control.</p>
        <p>
          Correct exercises – not magical machines, but actual movement and
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>The only “magical machine” is your own body.</p>
        <p>Real Truth About Fitness:</p>
        <p>Real bodybuilders know:</p>
        <p>The true machine is your body.</p>
        <p>Gym equipment is just a tool to help you build your own body.</p>
        <p>
          These machines can help a little, but they don’t replace effort or
          exercise.

          Youth is precious. Use it wisely, and don’t let bitterness poison it.

        <p>
          Men Going Their Own Way should be about freedom, joy, and
          self-discovery — not hate or laziness.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s so much out there to explore and enjoy. Why let anyone else
          decide how you live?

          Loser (Smartest) – A "Loser" is a man who stops following society’s
          path. He doesn’t just avoid being controlled by women—he goes against
          everything. Think of Bill Gates or Steve Jobs—they dropped out of
          college and succeeded. Society calls such men "losers" when they don’t
          live by the rules. But in reality, they’re strong, independent, and
          free.

        <p>Listen and understand her instead of trying to “fix” things.</p>
        <p>Share agreement when you connect with her feelings or traits.</p>
        <p>
          Be direct and honest if she upsets you — women respect strength, not
          weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use humor to keep things light, but take her seriously when she opens
          up.

          You are free to live life however you want. But doing that is hard
          because it means changing yourself.
        </p>

        <p>You Have the Power</p>

          Blaming others (like the government or feminists) gives away your
          power.

        <p>Choosing to be unhappy is still a choice.</p>
        <p>
          Life doesn’t have to be serious or painful — it can be exciting and
          free, if you take control.
        </p>

        <p>Life is to Be Lived - Grab life and enjoy it.</p>
        <p>When you do this, you stop caring what people think of you.</p>
        <p>
          But if you care too much about what people think—you are their
          prisoner.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you believe getting women is hard, it will be hard. If you believe
          it’s fun and simple, it will be. The same goes for becoming rich. If
          you believe it’s enjoyable and possible, it becomes easier.
        </p>

        <p>Seek approval from women or society and lose themselves.</p>
        <p>
          Men Going Their Own Way means living by your own rules, not others’.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life is to be lived. Life is meant to be grabbed on to. When you do
          this, you no longer worry about what other people think of you. And if
          you DO worry about what other people think of you, then you are
          imprisoned by it.
        </p>

        <p>Be Who You Are</p>
        <p>MGTOW is about escaping this mental prison.</p>
        <p>
          While most people are living their lives worried about others’
          opinions, you’ll be free.
        </p>
        <p>Instead of just reacting to life… You will start acting on life.</p>

        <p>Negativity Is a Monster—You Must Fight It</p>
        <p>Fight Negativity with Positivity</p>
        <p>
          Happiness and positivity are powerful and attractive—more than sadness
          or negativity. Negativity holds you back, makes life worse, and pushes
          people away. Pessimism stops growth, action, and learning. Optimism
          sells because people crave hope—it takes real strength to stay
          positive. Everyone carries some negativity, but you must fight it like
          a monster—with clarity and logic. People follow happy, hopeful,
          successful energy—not gloom and doom.
        </p>

        <p>You’re not getting any younger. So don’t waste your time.</p>

        <mark>Become Financially Free</mark>
        <p>
          Becoming financially free is one of the most powerful things you can
          do. It means you control your life. Your assets (like savings or
          investments) pay your expenses, so you don’t need a job. Many books
          explain how to do this, so I won’t repeat that. Instead, I want to
          ask:
        </p>

        <p>
          From age 5, we’re put in school and told what to do. This continues
          through college, jobs, and into retirement. Doing "nothing" is labeled
          lazy, so men are trained to work constantly. That's why the founder of
          MTV once said: If you can retire, do nothing for a year. It will be
          the hardest thing you’ve ever done. To remove the brainwashing to work
          every time for a life from the age 5…
        </p>

        <p>
          Real freedom comes from valuing your time, health, and purpose—not
          just money.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of doing that, the author wants to live in the real world. He
          wants to enjoy life, be flesh and blood, and stop fighting over ideas.
          He even says he'd love to burn his library and just live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophy is useful for gaining foresight, which helps us avoid
          painful mistakes. There are two main ways to learn in life:
        </p>
        <p>Experience – painful but effective</p>
        <p>Foresight – gentle and preventive</p>
        <p>
          It’s wiser to learn through foresight (like understanding risks before
          marriage) rather than through suffering. So, use philosophy to gain
          necessary insights—but don’t overthink. Once you've learned what you
          need, move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience teaches harshly, brutally, while foresight teaches gently,
          patiently, pleasingly. As for my master, I choose foresight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The greatest revenge is living well. If you want to get underneath a
          politician's skin, don't give in to "rebuttals" or take them
          seriously. Rather, mock them and make fun of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, don’t be drunk on philosophy or sadness. Live life, be a
          person of flesh and blood, and enjoy being a man. It’s better to laugh
          and be foolish than to be too serious and sad.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of the physical bravery we see in people—like doing dangerous or
          bold things—is actually just a way for them to cover up the fact that
          they didn’t have the courage to be their true selves. They lacked
          moral courage, which means the strength to live honestly as yourself.
          So instead, they try to prove themselves through bold physical acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution? Be who you are. That’s the First Rule of Pookism- Being
          yourself fixes many of the problems you’ve created for yourself by
          pretending or hiding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t just take my word for it. Steve Jobs - Trust your instincts,
          follow what you love, be yourself.

        <mark>Men’s Mediocrity</mark>
        <p>
          Most men become wage slaves, working nonstop just to pay bills, not
          because financial freedom is impossible, but because society programs
          them not to question the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many don't try to escape because of relationships. After college, men
          fall in love, get married, buy a house, and have children—raising
          expenses and stress. They keep working harder, not for personal
          growth, but to keep the system running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophy can help, but it can also be a trap. When people are hurt,
          they often cling to philosophy like a drunk person clings to a bottle.
        </p>

        <mark>Feminism</mark>
        <p>Men Are More Free Now</p>
        <p>
          Women's liberation also freed men. Men no longer have to follow old
          rules like marrying early or being the sole provider. You now have the
          freedom to choose your own path—family or not.
        </p>

        <p>Western Women Still Don’t Understand Men</p>
        <p>
          Many Western women embrace a "girl boss" mindset and don’t understand
          why men are avoiding marriage and dating. Instead of reflecting, they
          blame men, saying, “Men today are just weak.”
        </p>

        <mark>Happiness</mark>
        <p>Why Are You Unhappy?</p>
        <p>You're unhappy because you know life could be better.</p>
        <p>You have two choices:</p>
        <p>Blame others</p>
        <p>Or take action to change your life</p>
        <p>
          No one’s coming to save you — everyone’s too busy thinking about
          themselves and how you see them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimism is powerful and attractive; people follow joy, not gloom.
        </p>

        <mark>Women</mark>
        <p>Why Do Women Have So Much Power?</p>
        <p>
          Women have power because men give it to them by seeking their
          approval.
        </p>
        <p>MGTOW means taking back control of your life.</p>
        <p>
          You choose your path—not your parents, family, religion, government,
          society, or girlfriend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tradeoff: if you fail, it’s on you. But it's better to live with
          your own mistakes than someone else's.
        </p>

        <p>
          For women, the best moment might be relaxing in a warm bath on a
          tropical island. For men, it’s about truth, ideals, and winning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women are often more practical, like accountants, while men may be
          emotional and idealistic. Women value comfort and usefulness; men
          value truth and victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some women are attracted to violent men because they associate
          violence with confidence.

          Housewife (Smartest) – This is the ultimate achievement for women.
          These women live in peaceful homes with technology that does most
          chores. They relax and do what they want. Feminists often attack
          housewives out of jealousy.

        <mark>MGTOW</mark>
        <p>Men Can Find Options Around the World</p>
        <p>
          Men today have global choices for love, romance, and fun—you’re no
          longer limited to your local city or country. Want a traditional wife?
          Try the Philippines. Want excitement? Try Brazil or Russia. Want
          casual fun? Try Thailand.
        </p>

        <p>Marriage Isn’t Popular Anymore in the U.S.</p>
        <p>
          Fewer men are marrying in America. Many now live together without
          marriage. Men are realizing how unfair the legal system can be in
          divorce and child custody.
        </p>

        <p>More Men Are Waking Up</p>
        <p>
          More men are realizing they don’t have to follow society’s old
          rules—there are better options. So ask yourself: What do you want in
          life? Go after it with energy!
        </p>

        <p>
          Loser (Smartest) – A "Loser" is a man who stops following society’s
          path. He doesn’t just avoid being controlled by women—he goes against
          everything. Think of Bill Gates or Steve Jobs—they dropped out of
          college and succeeded. Society calls such men "losers" when they don’t

          If you believe getting women is hard, it will be hard. If you believe

          Eventually, they associate self-worth with productivity. When they
          finally retire, many feel lost or even die soon after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men who keep working lose their most valuable things: time and health.
          Then it's too late to become financially free — even if they realize
          what’s happening.
        </p>
        <p>Look at the average life:</p>
        <p>Factory-style childhood in schools.</p>
        <p>Factory-style colleges.</p>
        <p>Factory-style jobs.</p>
        <p>Cookie-cutter houses and suburbs.</p>
        <p>Retire on factory-style pensions.</p>
        <p>Then move to factory-style nursing homes.</p>
        <p>That’s 95% of people’s lives.</p>

        <p>Financial Freedom Unlocks True Self</p>
        <p>
          Most great art, music, and ideas came from people who had free time,
          often due to wealth—not poverty. Even historical icons like George
          Washington were financially free, which gave them space to grow
          intellectually and culturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial freedom isn’t about greed. It’s about having the time and
          freedom to become who you truly are. Whether it's writing poetry or
          racing cars, freedom lets you pursue your passion—something a 9-to-5
          job often blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a saying: "Job" = Just Over Broke. Jobs keep you surviving,
          not thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Money doesn’t change who you are—it changes how others treat you. Some
          friends may get jealous. Freedom can be lonely.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Esther Vilar said in The Manipulated Man: A man who sacrifices his
          dreams to work and support a family is called responsible. But a man
          who lives for himself, on his terms, is rejected by society. A truly
          free man doesn’t fit into the modern system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Politics used to be different. In the past, leaders would talk clearly
          about right and wrong. Now, politics has become more “feminized.”
          Politicians act more like women: they talk too much, care more about
          appearances and popularity.
        </p>

        <p>
          When men and women try to look through the lace curtain, they only see
          a reflection—they project their own lives onto the other side. Women
          think men are also living in paradise. So if a man stays home to study
          or doesn't party, women think something must be wrong with him.
