        <p>

          book is banned on all platform because feminist don’t want to. this is
          must read for all man from age 5 to 200.
        </p>
        <p>
          here i know how generation by generation man just lived in pursuit to
          impress women in exchange for the sex not more than that , man just
          became slave of it.
        </p>
        <p>

          we are living. we get one life and wasting being just slave.

        <p>below is the detailed summary of book :</p>

        <p></p>

        <mark>the slave happiness... </mark>
        <p>
          why, if men are stronger, smarter, and more creative, they are the
          ones being used.
        </p>

        <p>
          She suggests that these very qualities may make them better suited for
          servitude, while women — despite being perceived as weaker — end up in
          control how women manage to make men feel proud and superior while
          actually keeping them in a subordinate, exploited position, and why
          this manipulation is never exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do women give men this sense of pride and superiority that pushes
          them to achieve more and more?
        </p>

        <mark>what is man?</mark>
        <p>
          what makes a “real” man — someone whose life revolves around working
          to support a woman and her children.
        </p>

        <p>
          She says men’s appearance, clothing, and even personal grooming are
          shaped by their role as workers, with practicality prioritized over
          self-expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men have little freedom in choosing their work; once they show skill
          in something, they’re trapped in it for life, often doing repetitive,
          degrading tasks they don’t truly enjoy. Despite this, men feel proud
          of providing for others and find comfort in being “enslaved” by
          responsibility, especially to a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter ends by asking: who is this woman who keeps men dependent
          and makes them feel secure only when serving her?
        </p>
        <mark>what is woman?</mark>
        <p>
          What Is Woman? women and men are born with the same mental potential,
          but most women choose comfort, security, and reliance on men instead
          of developing their minds. From a young age, many plan to live off a
          man in exchange for sex, and once they make that choice, they stop
          serious intellectual growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men wrongly assume women want the same ambitions and freedoms they do,
          so they invent tools, offer education, and even give political rights
          to “liberate” them. But women often use free time for domestic hobbies
          or self-beautification rather than intellectual or political
          engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author argues women’s dependence on men is practical, not
          emotional, so they don’t feel oppressed and see no need to “break
          free.” Women can choose independence but usually prefer a comfortable,
          parasitic life, unlike men who must work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when exposed to big political or philosophical movements, women
          often adopt only the fashion, not the ideas.
        </p>

        <mark>the horizon of a woman</mark>
        <p>
          in a woman’s world, other women’s opinions matter far more than men’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          women dress, groom, and present themselves primarily to impress other
          women, not men — men are mainly valued as providers. Compliments from
          men are less meaningful than approval from another woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          men can be easily pleased by stereotypical beauty symbols, but women’s
          real efforts in appearance — detailed makeup, fashion choices — are
          aimed at female judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          women secure and keep workers (men) for their benefit, replacing them
          if needed without deep emotional involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          women are portrayed as less driven by male looks, rarely jealous of a
          man leaving for someone else, and often interacting with other women
          in ways men misunderstand.
        </p>
        <p>
          most advertising targets women using female beauty, not male
          attractiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          without financial dependence, many women would choose to live mainly
          among other women (such as lesbian), as they share more in common with
          each other than with men.
