        <h2 class="pages-title">The Manipulated Man by Esther Vilar</h2>

        <p>
          this book is literally thought provoking and now i understand why this
          book is banned on all platform because feminist don’t want to. this is
          must read for all man from age 5 to 200.
        </p>
        <p>
          here i know how generation by generation man just lived in pursuit to
          impress women in exchange for the sex not more than that , man just
          became slave of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          everything now we do we do to praise women, not thyself, what the fake
          we are living. we get one life and wasting being just slave.

        <p></p>

        <mark>the slave happiness</mark>
        <p>
          why, if men are stronger, smarter, and more creative, they are the
          ones being used.
        </p>

        <p>
          She suggests that these very qualities may make them better suited for
          servitude, while women — despite being perceived as weaker — end up in
          control how women manage to make men feel proud and superior while
          actually keeping them in a subordinate, exploited position, and why
          this manipulation is never exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do women give men this sense of pride and superiority that pushes
          them to achieve more and more?
        </p>

        <mark>what is Man?</mark>
        <p>
          what makes a “real” man — someone whose life revolves around working
          to support a woman and her children. She says men’s appearance,
          clothing, and even personal grooming are shaped by their role as
          workers, with practicality prioritized over self-expression. Men have
          little freedom in choosing their work; once they show skill in
          something, they’re trapped in it for life, often doing repetitive,
          degrading tasks they don’t truly enjoy. Despite this, men feel proud
          of providing for others and find comfort in being “enslaved” by
          responsibility, especially to a woman. The chapter ends by asking: who
          is this woman who keeps men dependent and makes them feel secure only
          when serving her?
        </p>
        <mark>what is Woman?</mark>
        <p>
          What Is Woman? women and men are born with the same mental potential,
          but most women choose comfort, security, and reliance on men instead
          of developing their minds. From a young age, many plan to live off a
          man in exchange for sex, and once they make that choice, they stop
          serious intellectual growth. Men wrongly assume women want the same
          ambitions and freedoms they do, so they invent tools, offer education,
          and even give political rights to “liberate” them. But women often use
          free time for domestic hobbies or self-beautification rather than
          intellectual or political engagement. The author argues women’s
          dependence on men is practical, not emotional, so they don’t feel
          oppressed and see no need to “break free.” Women can choose
          independence but usually prefer a comfortable, parasitic life, unlike
          men who must work. Even when exposed to big political or philosophical
          movements, women often adopt only the fashion, not the ideas.
