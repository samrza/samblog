        <h2 class="pages-title">My Rules</h2>
        <p>
            this is the concrete rule i follow although i have not seen this world too much but based on life i have lived.
        </p>
        <h3>Do's</h3>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h3>Don't</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><Mark>Backbiting</Mark> - anything that harm other person dignity is backbiting.  if what I say about my brother is in fact truth? Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) replied, if are right, you have slandered him, and if what you say of him is not true, you have reviled him. [1] my key takeaway is - وَيْلٌ لِكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُمَزَةٍ “Woe to every persistent slanderer, persistent defamer” “I will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of everybody.” ― Benjamin Franklin. On the flip side… If you are a victim of backbiting take comfort in knowing that they are only helping you on the day of judgement. Of course protect your character if you feel it is threatened but do so with integrity. Do not fall victim by engaging in the same game. We must show discipline and emotional fortitude and overcome such petty altercations. </li>
                <li><mark>Religion and Politics</mark> - i always keep away from any type of debate if i know other person just came here to show me down and really don't want constructive debate, what i do is i give up arguing even i am right i am talking with fool with sense of what that information is. even you call your friend is filled with hatred pulling legs, crabs in the bucket.i do talk on religion and poilitcs but to exchange information, not to fight it's a childish. </li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
