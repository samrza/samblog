        <h2>Part 1: The Idea</h2>

        <p>
        
          deep work = rare , hard to replicate<br />
          shallow work = non demanding , easy replicable<br />

          

          <mark> deep life is not just economically lucarative but also life well
          lived</mark> <br /><br />


          <h3>1. Deep Work is Valuable</h3>

          Deep work reduces attention residue and leads to higher performance<br />
          streamlines attention and increase happiness ( neurological )<br />
          generates flow that satisfies our life ( flow - psychological )<br />
          mindset of craftmanship ( builder )<br />
          those who will thrive are - high skilled worker, superstars, owners<br /><br />

          four pillar of deep work :<br />
          1. two core abilities of thriving<br />
          a. ability to quickly master hard things<br />
          b. ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and
          speed.<br />
          quality determines opportunity time and speed determines competition
          out.<br /><br />

          how deep work enables mastery : <br />
          deliberate practice <br />
          <mark>high quality work produced = time spent x
          intensity of focus</mark><br /><br />
          problem - attention residue<br />
          soln - work on single task for long period without switching<br /><br />

          <h3>2. Deep Work is Rare</h3>

         shallow work is easier - so mass prefer <br />
          a. the principle of least resistance - we naturally gravitate towards
          what easier at that moment.<br />
          b. busyness as proxy for productivity<br />
          c. culture of connectivity<br /><br />
          <h3>3. Deep Work is Meaningful</h3>
          if you read flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi then you know why deep work is valuable <br />
          our brain construct our worldview based on what we pay attention
          to.<br />
          deep work focus your attention on thing that matter creating richer
          mental world.<br /><br />

          <h2>Part 2: The Rules (How to do Deep Work)</h2>

          there are 4 ways you can incorporate deep work in your life: <br />
          Monastic: Eliminate almost all shallow work and stay permanently disconnected to focus deeply.<br />

Bimodal: Alternate between long stretches of deep isolation and periods of normal, connected work.<br />

Rhythmic: Do deep work at the same time every day to make it a fixed habit.<br />

Journalistic: Switch into deep work mode whenever time appears, without a fixed schedule.<br /><br />

i prefer rythmic bcz this fits my lifestyle, but most of you also use this. <br /><br />
          
   
          <h3>Rule#1 : Work Deeply</h3>
          
          willpower is limited, you have to establish routine.<br />
          strategies for work deeply<br />
          where/when/how(no distraction , metric for success, phone or other
          devices -nt)<br />
          support:material organized in advance and ready<br />
          coffee or tea to initiate<br /><br />

          4 discipline of execution (4dx)<br />
          1. focus on wildly important - one or two , not catching rabbit<br />
          2. act on the lead measure - for deep work track hours<br />
          3. keep a compelling scorecard - visual that you have doing
          consitenylty in row<br />
          4. create a accountability - check what went wrong good/bad each
          week<br /><br />

          shutdown ritual - be lazy<br />
          complete mental shutdown— turn off all related to work after
          particular time .<br />
          do plan or or schedule for next day then completely off.<br />
          and next day you will do what you have to do in work.<br />
          this is crucisl for sustaining deep work..<br /><br />

          <h3>Rule#2 : Embrace Boredom</h3>

          
          the ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be
          trained<br /><br />

          strategy 1 - schedule your internet use<br />
          schedule when you will not use internet use<br />
          resist and be bored at that interval<br /><br />

          strategy 2. - roosevelt dashes<br />
          identify high-priority deep work<br />
          estimate how long<br />
          set a hard deadline<br />
          work until completion<br />
          to make a habit - start with once /week . after few month you will see
          result actually what focus is.<br /><br />

          strategy 3 - productive meditation<br />
          activities to do - walking , jogging, showering , driving, driving
          ,dishes etc.<br />
          process:<br />
          1. choose one well defined professional problem<br />
          2. define variable, next step etc thing about question<br />
          3. work through problem mentally<br />
          4. consolidate your answer afterward<br />
          habit - 2/3 times per week<br /><br />

          obstacles you will face :<br />
          Looping - your mind rehearse what you know, instead of diving
          deeper.<br />
          soln - acknowledge it and go to next step<br />
          distraction - unrelated through<br />
          acknowledgement it, comeback to problem<br /><br />

          strategy 4 - memorize a deck of card<br /><br />

          <h3>Rule#3: Quit Social Media</h3>

          ###rules 3 - quit social media<br />
          problem - any-benefit mindset<br />
          soln : craftsmanship approach to tool selection<br /><br />

          process :<br />
          1. identify your main high level goal<br />
          professional goal (2-3)<br />
          personal goal ( 2-3)<br />
          2. identify 2-3 most important activities that help you achieve
          goal.<br />
          3. assess each tool<br />
          Q what positive impact does it have on these on these key activities
          ?<br />
          Q what negative impact does it have ?<br />
          4. keep if the positive outweigh negative, otherwise quit.<br /><br />

          ##THE LAW OF VITAL FEW ( 80/20 rule)<br />
          out of 10-15 supporting your goal, only 2-3 actually make significant
          difference, other literally steal time.<br /><br />

          30 day social media ban challenge<br />
          to break fomo:<br />
          1. ban yourself from all social media for 30 days.<br />
          2. don’t anounce you are doing this.<br />
          3. don’t formally delete.<br /><br />

          after 30 days ask 2 question :<br />
          a) would the last 30 days have been notably better if i used this
          service?<br />
          b) did people care that i wasn’t using this service.<br /><br />

          decision rules :<br />
          both answer “no” - quit permanently<br />
          both answer “yes” - resume again<br />
          a month without it reveals how little actually miss<br /><br />

          dont use the internet to entertain yourself.<br />
          figure out in advance what you’ll do<br />
          have high quality alternative<br />
          don’t default to whatever catches you attention<br /><br />

          <h3>Rule#4 : Drain the Shallow </h3>
          
          don’t spend more time on shallow work<br /><br />

          ##time scarcity forces better decision about what matters ( eg.
          basecamp )<br />
          strategy #1 schedule every minute of your day<br />
          time blocking helps you bring thoughtful how you spend your time.<br />
          cal newport time blocking method<br /><br />

          strategy #2 quantify the depth of every activity<br />
          insight : find deep work that requires 5-6 month to master and work on
          it , other below it are the it the range of shallowness.<br /><br />

          strategy # 3 fixed schedule productivity<br />
          don’t work after the end time of the day<br /><br />

          strategy # 4 become hard to reach
