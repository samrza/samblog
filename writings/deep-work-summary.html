            deep work vs shallow work
        </p>

        <p>
          deep work = rare , hard to replicate
        </p>
        <p>
          shallow work = non demanding , easy replicable
        </p>
        <p>
          that only need isolation and focus
        </p>
        <p>
          rythmic approach work for me bcz I want deep work as a habit on the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          shallow work is easier - so mass prefer
        </p>
        <p>
          busyness != productivity
        </p>
        <p>
          a deep life is not just economically lucarative but also life well lived
        </p>

        <p>
          1. deep work is valuable :
        </p>
        <p>
          streamlines attention and increase happiness ( neurological )
        </p>
        <p>
          generates flow that satisfies our life ( flow - psychological )
        </p>
        <p>
          mindset of craftmanship ( builder )
        </p>
        <p>
          those who will thrive are - high skilled worker, superstars, owners
        </p>

        <p>
          four pillar of deep work :
        </p>
        <p>
          1. two core abilities of thriving
        </p>
        <p>
          a. ability to quickly master hard things
        </p>
        <p>
          b. ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          quality determines opportunity time and speed determines competition out.
        </p>

        <p>
          how deep work enables mastery
        </p>
        <p>
          1. deliberate practice - high quality work produced = time spent x intensity of focus
        </p>
        <p>
          problem - attention residue
        </p>

        <p>
          deep work is rare
        </p>
        <p>
          a. the principle of least resistance - we naturally gravitate towards what easier at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. busyness as proxy for productivity
        </p>
        <p>
          c. culture of connectivity
