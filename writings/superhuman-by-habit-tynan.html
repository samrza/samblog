        <p>
          Short Story About Me  : my story when i was in grade 11th that time i was just in the superficial self-improvement videos ,article etc bullshit. i have watched just watched tons of self improvement video per day thinking even i keep downlaoded it on my device thing if any video works my life will change.
          
          
        </p>
        <p>
          i was thinking everything externally( world to me ) instead of internally to externally ( like me to world ). that time i know habit is good, i have heard from big achiever i admire saying yeah habit is the thing, even the great socrates  said "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit". 
        </p>
        <p>
          then after 4 year i have 4 year i have realized something very simple and profound like buddha got enlightment - oh fuck everything is literally habit. Habit is the only way bypass all average chump or quitters bcz its same thing consistent you do unconsiously and automatically even you are not motivated.  
        </p>
        <p>
          About Tynan :His full name is i think only "TYNAN" I regret why i not met Tynan 2 years ago - he is a amazing guy living amazing life. Earlier he was professional gambler ( made enough money to retire), pickup artist ( herbal was the tynan in the game by neil strauss), Founder of cruiseSheet, Sett etc, Own a entire Island( this one was crazy), Lives Nomadically in the world and his RV, Tea Lover( extreme ), Minimalist,   and very much important friend or social circle of high achievers etc i don't know. you will be amazed-  Stan Lee (of Marvel comics fame) dubbed Tynan “The Quintessential Man”.

          <h2>Building Habits </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Habits are the closest we can get to having superpower.</li>
            <li>Habits are the engine that drives the people we most admire, they are better at building and sustaining new habits.</li>
            <li>we have got enough willpower per day just direct that small amount of willpower to building habit until it feel automatic instead of using willpower everytime to force that will not work for more than a day.</li>
            <li>By creating habits, we can move things from the “hard” category to the “easy” category, thus freeing up willpower to tackle more of the hard things.</li>
            <li>this takes effort, but establishing most habits takes the relatively short time of one to twelve months.</li>
            <li>already we all habit , we are built by it knowing or unknowingly - we are all creature of habit by design. you can have habit of procrastination, habit of smoking etc. <mark>You either have the habit of seeing the positive side of things or the negative side of things, and this single pattern will dominate your mood for the rest of your life.</mark>
            </li>
            <li>Because habits are such a fundamental component of who we are, when there is something with which we are discontent, we should examine our habits first. For example, if you aren't happy all of the time, it could be that your life is just terrible, but it's (exponentially) more likely that your set of habits contributes to making you unhappy.</li>
            <li>Good habits aren't more difficult to execute than bad habits, they're just harder to build</li>
            <li>Habits pay through compounding - six months of focused effort I now get fifty years or so of loving to work and the enjoyment of the dividends it pays.</li>
            <li>If you want to improve yourself permanently, you must develop more old habits, which is done by creating new habits and sticking with them until they mature into old habits.</li>
            <li>
              ultimate process for self-improvement is to add as many new positive habits as possible, working diligently to convert them to old habits and make room for more new habits.
            </li>
            <li>Think very long term - Habits can only be thought of rationally when looked at from a perspective of years or decades. The benefit in its cumulative impact it will have on your life in the long term. you must evaluate which habits to pick up, which to drop, and which are worth fighting for when the going gets tough.</li>
            <li><mark>Consistency is Everything</mark> - Your results will be commensurate with the consistency to which you execute your habits, not to the magnitude of their one-time impact.</li>
            <li><mark>First, be conservative when sizing your new habits."</mark></li>
            <li>Second, <mark>you should be very scared to fail to execute a habit, even once. </mark>By failing to execute, potentially you're not just losing a minor bit of progress, but rather threatening the cumulative benefits you'd accrue by establishing a habit.</li>
            <li>what to do when missed a day - first of all dont try to miss its a big think take it seriously but if you missed one make it forged rule don't miss twice - Missing two days of a habit is habit suicide. If missing one day reduces your chances by five percent, missing two days reduces it by forty percent or so. Three days missedis over </li>
            <li>When you first miss a habit, the next occurrence of it should become a top priority.</li>
            <li>You can't rely on willpower alone to get through the next day. It didn't work on the first day you skipped, and it's best to acknowledge that it probably won't work the next day. The solution is to plan your day around the habit for the next day.</li>
            <li>if you missed just make that thing very obvious - you're going to meditate directly after eating dinner, before you have the chance to get tired, make no space for thinking.</li>
            <li><mark>I don't like to break habits, but when I do break them, I make sure that it's a premeditated and conscious decision.</mark></li>
            <li>When planning a variance, make it concrete, black and white, and specify exactly when the variance will end. For example, instead of doing your regular gym routine while traveling through Europe, you commit to do twenty pushups every morning, and then as soon as you return home, resume your normal routine.</li>
            <li>You may be tempted to skip this sort of planning and believe that it is unnecessary, but the lazy energy-conserving part of your brain can be a very powerful enemy.</li>
            <li><mark>Just like a marriage, any habit that's intended to last forever will require loyalty through good and bad, sickness and health.</mark></li>
            <li><mark>Remember that the power of a habit isn't actually in the individual execution, but in the consistency. It is far far worse to skip doing something than to just do a horrible job of it.</mark></li>
            <li>until you've fully trained a habit, your brain will try to sabotage you. old way was just working fine, and the new way seems like a lot mental effort.</li>
            <li>The real danger of not following through with something is that your brain figures out that if it just puts a few small barriers in your way, it can go back to resting. This in itself becomes a habit, which you'll see in people that we might call quitters.</li>
            
            <li>something is their brain trying to preserve its low-energy efficiency."</li>
            <li>below is very very imp... ⤵︎⤵︎</li>
            <li><mark>A classic manifestation of this is tiredness while working. It is, of course, possible to be tired while working to the point where a nap would solve the problem, but that's very often not an appropriate remedy. I first noticed this when I'd be exhausted, too exhausted to possibly work, as I'd tell myself. I'd stop working and do something less mentally taxing. Within minutes I would be full of energy and wide awake. Rejuvenated, I'd get back to work, only to find that I was tired again. The solution to this problem is to push through and work anyway. Just do a terrible job if necessary, but make it clear to your brain that putting up token objections isn't enough to give it a rest. If you do this enough, your brain will actually stop trying to sabotage you, and you'll find that you don't get tired when you work, crave sweets when you try to avoid unhealthy foods, or feel like a victim when you should be critically assessing Yourself and planning.
</mark></li>
            <li>if you skipped habit - from next time day to some dayyou just do that habit + 1;, its a great way to keep the lazy brain in check.</li>
            <li>forgive and focus -  
              <mark> The whole point of building habits, though, is to live a better life. If you beat yourself up and lose self-esteem whenever you fail, that negativity will counteract the positivity of building habits</mark>
            </li>
            <li>if you don't make all of those mistakes at various points, you're probably not challenging youself enough, which means that you will not reach potential.</li>
            <li>Mistakes will happen, but the most important thing is how you react to them. If successes push you forward, but mistakes also push you forward, you will have a lot more forward progress than if success moves you forward but mistakes pull you back</li>
            <li>Use your mistakes to focus. They draw attention to an area that needs more attention, so give it that attention. Challenge yourself to do better next time</li>
            <li><mark>Forgive yourself easily, but remember the lessons you learn from mistakes. You've earned them, after all.</mark></li>
            <li>Celebrating success - simple moment of reflection and a moment of self-congratulation. It sounds lame, but it is the minimum viable reward, it works, and it can be repeated anywhere</li>
            <li>Whenever you stick to a habit, especially if it was difficult or you did particularly well, take two seconds, smile, and congratulate yourself. A fist pump coupled with a, 'Yes!' might be in order. It feels silly and trite, but it serves its purpose of releasing endorphins and marking progress</li>
            <li>Small actions like rewarding yourself with a moment of congratulations combine to build a personal system of habit building.</li>
          </ul>
