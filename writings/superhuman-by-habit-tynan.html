        <h2 class="pages-title">SuperHuman by Habit - Tynan</h2>

        <p>Introduction:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The author once had poor habits: procrastination, irregular sleep,
            lateness, and unfinished projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turning Point: Realized goals don’t come just from desire → habits
            are the foundation of success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Committed fully to learning habit-building through books and
            self-experiments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initially feared habits would make life boring, but instead found
            they created freedom by automating essentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Current lifestyle: daily writing, language study, healthy eating,
            workouts, and consistent sleep → looks like discipline but is just
            habits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Core idea: Habits = superpowers that make progress automatic and
            achievable for anyone.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>What is a Habit?</p>
        <p>
          A habit = an action repeated with little/no thought or effort;<br />
          Power = reduces need for willpower → things become automatic;<br />
          Habits = energy-efficient “shortcuts” for success.
        </p>

        <p>
          High achievers aren’t superhuman → they just mastered habits; Bank
          account metaphor:<br />
          Habit builders = savers (long-term compounding benefit).<br />
          Non-habit builders = paycheck-to-paycheck (constantly strained).<br />
          <mark
            >Willpower is limited → best use of it is investing in habits, not
            daily effort. Don’t spend willpower daily—invest it into building
            habits.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>Benefits of Habits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make hard tasks automatic.</li>
          <li>Free willpower for bigger challenges.</li>
          <li>Prevent burnout; enable productive, healthy, happy life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We Already Run on Habits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most daily actions are subconscious (e.g., brushing teeth,
            procrastination).
          </li>
          <li>Outlook, relationships, success shaped by habits.</li>
          <li>Life improves by replacing bad habits with good ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Good vs. Bad Habits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good habits = harder to build, not harder to maintain.</li>
          <li>Example: procrastination = easy → poor work ethic.</li>
          <li>
            Productive habits: tough at first, then effortless and rewarding.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Short-Term Cost, Long-Term Payoff:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Habit building takes weeks–months of effort.</li>
          <li>Once formed, habits run automatically for life.</li>
          <li>Example: 6 months effort → decades of productive life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>New vs. Old Habits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            New habit = conscious effort (“doing”), Old habit = identity-level
            (“being”).
          </li>
          <li>
            Goal: convert new habits → old habits; develop more old habits by
            creating new ones and sticking with them until they mature.
          </li>
          <li>Continuous self-improvement = upgrade habits over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          An action whose magnitude is very small becomes a big deal when
          repeated over and over; Example: one cigarette ≈ negligible,
          thousands/year → serious harm; one cup of green tea ≈ minor, daily
          over years → improved health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shifting from slightly harmful → slightly beneficial habits is more
          important than making huge short-term gains.<br />
          Sustainable progress comes from consistent, positive habits over
          months and years, not from occasional extreme effort.<br />
          <mark
            >“The power of a habit is in its cumulative effect over years, not
            the magnitude of a single action.”</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>Consistency beats intensity:</p>
        <p>
          Long-term modest habits &gt; short-term extreme habits; results come
          from execution frequency, not one-time effort.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be conservative when sizing your new habits; Start small & sustainable
          and easy — easier to keep (e.g., do one DSA problem, wake up at 7 am
          instead of 5 am).<br />
          Never skip a habit — skipping risks breaking the chain and losing
          cumulative benefit; make it conscious: admit clearly why you skip.<br />
          <mark
            >“Excuses lose power when you are forced to say them out
            loud.”</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Missing is human: Even the best habit builders skip sometimes.<br />
          <mark
            >Missing two days of a habit is habit suicide; Golden rule: Never
            skip two days in a row. One skip = small damage, two skips = near
            habit death.</mark
          ><br />
          Momentum matters: Each miss multiplies chance of quitting; Recovery
          strategy: next execution = top priority.<br />
          <mark
            >Don’t trust optimism: If you skipped once, you can’t assume you’ll
            “just do it tomorrow.”</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          In life, control ≠ always possible: At home, habits are easy;
          travel/life changes bring challenges.<br />
          Example: Traveling → 20 pushups daily → resume full gym on return.<br />
          <mark
            >“A planned break is a pause. An unplanned break is the beginning of
            quitting.”</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Planning vs. reality: Habits in ideal states vs. real life; Golden
          rule: Never skip — even if output is awful; Terrible work > no work;
          Consistency > quality.<br />
          <mark
            >Too tired to write? Write garbage, even random words — it still
            counts.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Your brain resists change: Old habits feel easy, new ones feel like
          “wasted effort.”<br />
          <mark
            >Danger of giving in: If you quit when it gets hard, your brain
            learns → “Throw up obstacles, brain gets rest/reward; This becomes
            its own bad habit - Quitter’s loop.”</mark
          ><br />

          Push through anyway; over time, brain sabotages less → more
          self-control.<br />
          <mark
            >Every time you give in, you train your brain to quit. Every time
            you push through, you train it to obey.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Inconsistency ≠ habit; “sometimes” doesn’t count.<br />
          Recovery strategy: repay missed habits; Works best for small
          repeatable habits.<br />
          Example: Forgot floss today → next day floss twice to signal your
          brain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be your own Miyagi: Tough discipline + real care; Skips are bad,
          quitting worse; Mistakes = inevitable.<br />
          <mark>Fail forward: forgive fast, learn faster.</mark>
        </p>

        <p>
          Rewards matter: Reinforce habits positively instead of punishing
          yourself; Small rewards work; cumulative effect is powerful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take pride in process, not results; Process is controllable; Avoid
          stress traps; Long-term adherence > short-term wins.<br />
          <mark>Measure yourself by your actions, not outcomes.</mark>
        </p>

        <p>
          Being honest: Brutal self-honesty is essential for choosing and
          sustaining effective habits; Criticizing yourself harshly undermines
          growth.<br />
          <mark
            >Brutal honesty with yourself is the first step to building
            life-changing habits.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          How to Discover High Priority Habits: Personal choice, biggest
          obstacles first, must matter to you; Top-down vs. bottom-up
          approaches; Feedback from others; Explore “not me” areas; Social
          skills priority; Phase habit building strategically.

          <h1>Question to Reflect :-</h1>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Which 3 things do I already do every day without thinking (good or
              bad)?
            </li>
            <li>
              If I zoomed out 10 years, how will these habits compound —
              positively or negatively?
            </li>
            <li>
              What one “automatic” habit do I rely on most right now (like
              brushing teeth, checking phone, eating something daily)?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>2. Willpower as Investment</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Where am I currently spending willpower every single day that
              could instead be automated into a habit?
            </li>
            <li>
              What’s one draining thing I repeat daily that I could make “easy”
              through habit?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>3. Consistency & Never Skipping Twice</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              What’s a simple habit I could realistically do every single day
              without fail? (ex: drink a glass of water in the morning, do 5
              push-ups)
            </li>
            <li>
              How will I handle it if I miss a day? (Write the backup plan for
              day two).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>4. Plan Variances</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              What situations usually break my habits (travel, late nights,
              stress, family, exams, etc.)?
            </li>
            <li>
              How can I plan a light version of my habit for those times? (ex:
              instead of gym, 20 pushups in hotel).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>5. Doing a “Terrible Job”</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Which habit can I still do in “crappy mode” instead of skipping?
            </li>
            <li>
              What would a minimum version look like? (ex: write 1 sentence
              instead of 500 words, meditate 1 minute instead of 20).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>6. Brutal Honesty</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Where am I lying to myself about why I’m stuck? (health, money,
              relationships, work ethic)
            </li>
            <li>
              Which weakness — if fixed — would ripple positively into many
              areas of my life?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>7. Discovering High Priority Habits</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Which single habit is currently the biggest drag on my life or
              leaks into other areas?
            </li>
            <li>
              Which habit do I truly care about changing right now (not just
              “should”)?
            </li>
            <li>
              What area of life have I been saying “that’s just not me”? (social
              skills, fitness, discipline, meditation, etc.)
            </li>
          </ol>
